SoftwareProjectDay
==================
General:
    - The firm opens at 8:00am and closes at 5:00pm
    - One minute of simulated time takes 10ms of real time (thus 8 hours takes 4800ms or 4.8 seconds)


Employee Requirements:
    - Employees may arrive anytime between 8:00 and 8:30, take lunch for at least 30 minutes but no more than an hour,
      and leave anytime from 4:30 to 5:00 as long as they work at least 8 hours.
    - At any point during the day, a team member may ask a question of his or her team lead.
      There is an 50% chance that the team lead can answer the question, at which time the lead
      and the team member return to work.
    - Employees start leaving from 4:30 to 5:00 as they complete their 8 hour days.
    - When not asking questions, at meetings, or at lunch, team leads and developers
      are hard at work designing, coding and testing.
    - When developers ask the team lead a question that the lead can answer no time elapses (i.e., response is instantaneous).
    - Developers may not ask questions during the morning stand-up meeting or the afternoon project status meeting.
    - At 4:00 every day leaders and members of all teams start assembling in the conference room for a project status update.
      It is expected that members will finish arriving by 4:15, allowing 15 minutes to clean up any work in progress.
      When all members have gathered, the manager spends 15 minutes discussing the project status
        Team Lead:
            - After the meeting, the team leads wait for all the members of their team to arrive.
              When all members of a team are present, the team lead waits for the one-and-only team
              conference room to become available, enters the room with all team members, and holds
              a holds a team-based stand-up meeting for 15 minutes.


Project Manager:
    - In charge of 3 teams of developers, each team consisting of a team lead and 3 additional
      developers (12 developers in all).
    - When he arrives at 8:00 each day, the manager engages in daily planning activities and then waits (doing administrivia)
      until all the team leads arrive at his office. When all the leads have arrived, they knock on the manager's door
      and enter for their daily 15 minute stand-up meeting.
    - The manager has two daily executive meetings, each lasting one hour, one from 10:00 to 11:00 and one from 2:00 to 3:00.
      In addition, the manager eats lunch for one hour starting as close to from 12:00 as possible to 1:00. If in the middle
      of answering a question when a meeting or lunch begins, the manager finishes answering the question and then goes to
      the meeting or lunch. Any other teams with questions simply wait for the manager to return.
    - The project manager is the last to leave at 5:00.
    - When not answering questions, at meetings, or at lunch, the manager does whatever it is managers do
