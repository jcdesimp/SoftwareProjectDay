The program to be executed is in Main.java.
When the program is executed, it begins immediately initializing objects
and preparing to start the "day." It then starts all the threads through
a latch. There is no user input needed.

There are a few known constants:
12 - number of employees, with 3 teams containing 4 people (and 1 lead each)
1 - number of Managers
4 - number of Team Leads
1 - number of conference rooms

The program prints out several statements anytime an event occurs, like
an employee asking a question or a manager going to lunch.
When defining the different workers, we assign them a number for their
team and position. One example is Developer "32" - He is the second
developer on team 3. Team leads are considered the first developer in
their team.

Here's a sample output of our program:
